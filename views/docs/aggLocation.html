        <p>The <code>agg-location</code> directive uses the Geolocation API to retrieve the users location and adds a custom marker to the map at that location. The marker is a custom OverlayView created by the AggLocationMarker factory.</p>
        <p>This directive requires the users permission for access to their location. In Chrome, the Geolocation API will only work on sites served from a secure context. (ie. HTTPS)</p>
        <p class="required">Requires the agg-map directive</p>
